### String object is immutable in Java, its reference variable is not.
e.g. 
> String str = "hello";  
> str = str.concat(" world");

JVM takes the value of String str, i.e. "hello" and appends " world", giving us the value "hello world".   
Now, since Strings are immutable, the JVM can’t assign this value to str, so it creates a new String object,   
gives it a value "hello world", and gives it reference str.

#### Reasons for making Strings Immutable in Java : 
- The String pool wasn't possible if String is mutable in Java. A lot of heap space is saved by JRE.   
The same string variable can be referred to by more than one string variable in the pool.   
String interning can also not be possible if the String would not be immutable.
    
- If we don’t make the String immutable, it will pose a serious security threat to the application.   
For example, database usernames, passwords are passed as strings to receive database connections.
- The String is safe for multithreading because of its immutableness. Different threads  
can access a single “String instance”. It removes the synchronization for thread safety    
because we make strings thread-safe implicitly.
